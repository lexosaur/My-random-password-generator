# My-random-password-generator

This is homework 3 of the bootcamp. We had to create a random password generator.

This password generator complies with the following requirements:

GIVEN that the user needs a new, secure password
WHEN they click the button to generate a password
THEN they are presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN they select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN they choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN they confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN they answer each prompt
THEN their input is validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
